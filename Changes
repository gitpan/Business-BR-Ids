Revision history for Perl extension Business-BR-Ids.

0.00_07 Tue Jul 15 2005 ?
        - the IE functions were made case-insensitive ('MG' works
	  the same as 'mg')
        - added IE handling for PR state (test, flatten, format,
	  random, and parse)
        - introduced _flatten in Business::BR::Ids::Common,
	  avoiding the redundant code of the various flatten_*()
	  methods
        - changed semantics of calling _dv_*() in scalar context -
	  instead of returning a concatenation of the check digits,
	  it returns a complete entity with check digits in
	  (in IE-SP the check digits are the ninth and 12nd -
	  so that the concatenation of check digits is good for nothing)

        - added IE handling for SP state (test, flatten,
	  format, and random)

        - Deprecates Business::BR::Biz (waiting for the move
	  of its content somewhere else)
        - README file revised
        - first revision to POD in Business::BR::CNPJ
	- new test "t/009_cnpj_rand.t"
        - random_cnpj() in Business::BR::CNPJ
        - test scripts renamed (eg. "t/dot.t" to "t/001_dot.t")
        - random() in Business::BR::Ids
	- new test "t/008_cpf_rand.t"
        - random_cpf() in Business::BR::CPF
        - introduced flatten() and parse() to Business::BR::Ids
	  with a small refactoring avoiding redundant code
        - fixed synopsis of Business::BR::Ids
        - test for _dot() with @a < @b now works for $] < 5.8

        - I thought about letting MakeMaker generate META.yml automatically 
	  again - but it does not generate the 'author' and 'licence' keys
	  which CPAN uses - so I insist on that
        - distribution renamed to Business-BR-Ids reflecting
	  the orientation of this set of files to deal with
	  identification codes (CPF, CNPJ for now)
        - added test "t/ids_test.t"
        - added Business::BR::Ids as a generic entry point
	  for dealing with Brazilian identification entities

        - tests "t/*_cpf.t" renamed to "t/cpf_*.t"
        - added new module Business::BR::CNPJ but POD is not finished
	  and tests aren't provided (except for a partial "t/cnpj_test.t")
        - the heart of the distribution goes to Business::BR::Biz
        - "_dot" goes to Business::BR::Biz::Common
        - the ABSTRACT fix of the previous version was not enough
	  for correct CPAN display - now using a META.yml with 'abstract' key
        - Adam Kennedy pointed that the general CPAN convention 
	  for naming distributions would suggest Business-BR instead of biz-br:
          I would like to stick to this distribution name to mean
	  a partial bundle of Business::BR::* modules I will be authoring
