Business-BR-Ids version 0.00_18
===============================

The intention of this distribution is to provide facilities
to deal with Brazilian identification numbers and codes.
It is part of a set of distributions to approach programming
on Brazilian business-related subjects.
The distribution is starting up with support to CPF and CNPJ
(tests for correctness, canonicalization, formatting, parsing,
random generation for mass tests). More is to come.

The actually supported codes follow along with a brief explanation
of what they are good for and who emits them.

  * CPF  - to identify citizens as taxpayers in nation-wide context, 
           emitted by the Brazilian Ministry of Revenue
  * CNPJ - to identify companies as taxpayers in nation-wide context, 
           emitted by the Brazilian Ministry of Revenue
  * PIS  - to identify citizens as users of the public health services
  * IE/AC
    IE/AL
    IE/AP
    IE/MA
    IE/MG
    IE/PR
    IE/RO
    IE/RR
    IE/SP
         - to identify companies as taxpayers in state-wide context,
           emitted by Revenue Secretariats of Brazilian States
           (by now supporting only the states of Acre, Alagoas,
           Amapá, Maranhão, Minas Gerais, Rondônia, Roraima, São Paulo 
           and Paraná)

Some of the next ones to be supported are:

  * IE   - to identify companies as taxpayers in state-wide contexts,
           emitted by the Secretariat of Revenue of each state
  * TE   - to identify citizens as allowed voters, emitted by
           Regional Electoral Courts under the control 
           of the Superior Electoral Court
